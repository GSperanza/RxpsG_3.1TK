\usage{
XPSQuant()
}
\description{
XPSQuant() performs the elemental quantification 
  for a selected XPS-Sample. Provides a userfriendly interface 
  with the list of Corelines of the selected XPS-Sample
  Each Coreline can be count/omit from the elemental quantification.
  If peak fitting is present also each of the fitting component 
  can be count/omit from the elemental quantification.
  Finally also relative RSF of the coreline or individual fitting 
  components can be modified.
